Summary:
In this course, I gained hands-on experience in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Cucumber and Gherkin. The curriculum covered key concepts and techniques, including:

- Understanding the fundamentals of BDD and its role in Agile development.
- Writing clear and concise feature files using Gherkin syntax.
- Defining scenarios with Given, When, Then steps to describe system behavior.
- Integrating Cucumber with testing frameworks like Java, JavaScript, or Ruby.
- Running and managing automated BDD tests within a continuous integration pipeline.
- Debugging and improving BDD scenarios for better clarity and maintainability.

By the end of the course, I was able to create automated tests that enhance collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders, improving the quality and reliability of software applications.

More details: 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
